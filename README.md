# Python-Chat-Server

Python socket programming: I coded a host and server that talk to each other. To modify the code to work on your computer, 
open terminal on the machine running Python_Server.py and type ifconfig (ipconfig on Windows) and note the non-loopback 
inet6 IP address. Replace the TCP_HOST variable contents with the noted address.
